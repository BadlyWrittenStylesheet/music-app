## This project, is my first real try at using an API, in JS, which is not the language im very familiar, but I'm trying my best. It first started as a quick playlist maker, but for now I am trying to familiarize with the API.

### The current progress and future.

| Function   | What does it do                    | Works?               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| newToken() | grabbing a new token (just for me) | Yes                  |
| getTrack() | grabbing a track from an ID        | Yes                  |
| getTrack() | grabbing a track from an ID        | Work in progress     |

The getTrack func is just the start of doing something with the user and executing the initial idea of the project, so on to do list in bold text theres written **authorization from the user**. So I need to take care of that first.
